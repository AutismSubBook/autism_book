	\chapter*{Preface}
	I have recently tried to help family members and friends understand what autism is, so I've been looking for a good book to serve as a "quick and dirty" introduction to autism with some information on what autism is like and how to meet the needs of autistic people.
	
	Having been unsuccessful, here is this book!
